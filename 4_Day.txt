Scenario 1: Tricky situations. 
 
Client: Bank  
 
Project overview: Adding functionality to the website 
 
You are a tester. In this project you must test the test cases within 48 hours of receiving them. The project is in a critical phase. At this juncture, you receive the test cases one day late from the developer, Eashwar. This has set you back by one day. Write a mail to your manager Hareesh, giving him a heads up that the testing will be delayed by one day because of this. 
 
Catch: The developer involved is your friend. You don't want to seem like you are blaming him in the mail.
